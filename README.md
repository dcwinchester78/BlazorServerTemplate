# Steps to Create a Blazor Server .NET 9 Weather Forecast App with In-Memory Random Data Service

1. **Create a new Blazor Server project**
   - Use the .NET CLI or Visual Studio to create a new Blazor Server app targeting .NET 9.

2. **Define the Weather Forecast model**
   - Create a simple class representing a weather forecast, e.g. Date, TemperatureC, Summary.

3. **Implement a Weather Forecast service**
   - Create a service that holds an in-memory collection of possible weather data.
   - Implement logic to randomly pick forecasts for the next 7 days from this collection.

4. **Register the Weather Forecast service**
   - Register the service in the DI container in `Program.cs` as a scoped or singleton service.

5. **Create a Blazor component to display the forecast**
   - Build a Razor component (e.g. `Weather.razor`) that injects the service.
   - On initialization, request the 7-day forecast.
   - Display the data in a table or list with appropriate formatting.

6. **Update the main layout or navigation**
   - Add a navigation link or set the `Weather` component as the default page.

7. **Run and verify the app**
   - Build and run the app.
   - Confirm the weather forecasts appear and refresh as expected on reload.

This structure keeps your app simple, uses dependency injection properly, and cleanly separates data logic from UI.
